# 🧠 LeetCode + DSA Learning Journey 🚀  

Welcome to my public documentation space 👋  
Here I share my journey of learning and revising **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** while solving **LeetCode problems** in C++.  

This repository tracks my daily progress — from understanding fundamentals to building optimized solutions.  

---

## 🌱 About the Journey  
Each day, I aim to:  
- Revise one core DSA concept  
- Solve at least one LeetCode problem  
- Reflect and document the learning  

Learning in public keeps me accountable, consistent, and focused on long-term mastery.

## 🧩 Day 1 — Kickoff  
**LeetCode:** Solved *Two Sum* in C++ using a Hashmap (O(n) optimized solution).  
**DSA Revision:** Revised *Linked List* — creation, recursion, counting, sum, max, and search.  

🧠 Key takeaway: *Start with brute-force first. It makes the optimized logic feel obvious when you reach it.*

## 🎯 Goal  
To master **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking** through consistent daily learning.  
Each day → one problem + one DSA concept.  

> Consistency makes complexity simple ⚡
